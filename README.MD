# blueOS
#### A custom 64-bit operating system built from scratch for the x86_64 architecture.
The kernel is currently being loaded with Limine. I've written a custom bootloader in assembly with disk loading and conversion from LBA to CHS, but opted to switch to Limine afterwards since I built it for learning and wanted to focus primarily on the kernel. You can still find the custom bootloader in archive/, it also uses a FAT12 file system.

The linker script, makefile, and entry point are provided as part of the Limine standard example. Everything else (the whole kernel) is custom.
Goals:
- [ ] printf Implementation
- [ ] Global Descriptor Table
- [ ] Interrupt Descriptor Table
- [ ] Keyboard Input
- [ ] File system (FAT32)
- [ ] Paging
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Kernel/User mode separation
- [ ] Basic shell
- [ ] GUI
## Why?
I started this project to learn about how operating systems work, low level concepts, and low level programming. Since starting, I have learned so much about assembly, processor architecture, memory, etc. and it's been exceedingly helpful to becoming a better and more experienced programmer. Plus, it's very satisfying to watch your own code boot! ðŸ˜Š
## Building/Running
To run the OS:
- Use the executable file (bin/blueOS) or ISO (bin/blueOS.iso) with QEMU-x86_64 to emulate or Rufus to burn onto a USB, then boot on real hardware

To build from source:
- Run `BuildCross.sh` to build a cross-compiler for the project.
- Run `make` to build executable 
- (Optional) Run `./InstallLimine.sh` to install limine to the project directory (only relevant for ISO)
- (Optional) Create the ISO with `./CreateISO.sh`
- The executable and iso are in bin/
